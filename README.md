Small single page react app, which I created during my Bootcamp course. This was a project learning app, where we implement some of the modern features like local storage API, toggle the grid view, API call, and last but not least we try to implement some OOP concepts. Basically, we got data from the API, and try to model some of the data like they are real-world objects.
From this project, I learned some of the core specifications of the React and their ecosystem. The most painful thing ðŸ˜¥ for me was prop - drilling and the impossibility to send data to the parent component, but thanks god I learned some state management.
To run this app, please download the code, and type npm start in your console.

# BIT-PEOPLE

Small single page react app, which I created durring my bootcamp course. This was a project learning app, where we implement some of the modern features like local storage API,
toogle the grid view, api call, and last but not least we try to implement some OOP concepts. Basically we got data from the API, ande try to model some of the data like
they are real world objects.

From this project I learned some of the core specification of the React and their eco sysyem. The most painful thing ðŸ˜¥ for me was prop - drlling and impossibility to send data
to parent component, but thanks god I learned some state managment.

To run this app, please download the code, and type <b> npm start</b>  in your console.
